                <h3>3.4. With Your Consent</h3>
                <p>We may share your information with third parties when we have your explicit consent to do so. For example, if you agree to participate in a co-branded promotion or allow us to share your testimonials publicly.</p>

                <h3>3.5. Aggregated or Anonymized Data</h3>
                <p>We may share aggregated or anonymized data that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This type of data is often used for research, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, helping us to understand broad trends without compromising individual privacy.</p>

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your personal information is a top priority for us. We implement a variety of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. While no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt data during transmission between your browser and our servers, particularly for sensitive information like payment details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to your personal data is restricted to authorized employees, contractors, and service providers who need the information to perform their job functions. All personnel are trained on data privacy and security protocols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect and retain personal data that is necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy, minimizing the risk associated with data breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Audits and Assessments:</strong> We regularly review our security practices and conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in our systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have an incident response plan in place to address any potential data breaches swiftly and effectively, including notification procedures as required by law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Our data centers and physical infrastructure are protected with robust security measures to prevent unauthorized physical access.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> We carefully vet our third-party service providers to ensure they maintain adequate security measures for any personal data they process on our behalf.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Despite our best efforts, no security system is impenetrable. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will take immediate steps to mitigate the impact and notify affected individuals and regulatory authorities as required by applicable law.</p>

                <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. The retention period for different types of data varies depending on the purpose of collection and legal obligations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. If you close your account, we may retain certain data for a limited period to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Information related to your purchases (e.g., order history, payment records) is retained for longer periods as required by tax, accounting, and consumer protection laws.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication Data:</strong> Records of your communications with us may be retained for a period to allow us to refer back to past interactions for customer service improvement or dispute resolution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> We retain your marketing preferences for as long as you wish to receive marketing communications from us. If you opt-out, we will retain a record of your preference to ensure we do not send you unwanted communications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Anonymized Data:</strong> Data that has been anonymized or aggregated in such a way that it can no longer identify you may be retained indefinitely for analytical and research purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When your personal information is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize it in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws.</p>
