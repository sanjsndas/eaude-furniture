                <h2>Our Showroom / Physical Location</h2>
                <p>While our primary mode of operation is online, we understand the desire to experience the quality and design of Eaude Furniture firsthand. We are currently developing plans for a flagship showroom where you can immerse yourself in the essence of modern living and interact directly with our collections and design consultants. Details regarding our showroom opening, including location and appointment booking, will be announced on our website and social media channels as soon as they are available. Until then, our virtual tools, such as the Room Visualizer and Material Swatch Selector, offer an excellent way to experience our products.</p>

                <p><strong>Eaude Furniture Headquarters</strong><br>
